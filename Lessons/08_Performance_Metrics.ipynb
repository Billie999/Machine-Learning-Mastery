    "### Algorithm Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Various different algorithm evaluation metrics are demonstrated for both classification and regression type machine learning problems. In each recipe, the dataset is downloaded\n",
    "directly from the UCI Machine Learning repository.\n",
    "\n",
    " - For classification metrics, the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset is used as demonstration. This is a binary classi cation problem where all of the input variables are\n",
    "numeric.\n",
    "\n",
    " - For regression metrics, the Boston House Price dataset is used as demonstration. this is a regression problem where all of the input variables are also numeric.\n",
    "\n",
    "All recipes evaluate the same algorithms, Logistic Regression for classification and Linear Regression for the regression problems. A 10-fold cross validation test harness is used to\n",
    "demonstrate each metric, because this is the most likely scenario you will use when employing\n",
    "different algorithm evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "A caveat in these recipes is the \n",
    "cross validation.cross val score function used to\n",
    "report the performance in each recipe. It does allow the use of different scoring metrics\n",
    "that will be discussed, but all scores are reported so that they can be sorted in ascending\n",
    "order (largest score is best). Some evaluation metrics (like mean squared error) are naturally\n",
    "descending scores (the smallest score is best) and as such are reported as negative by the\n",
    "cross validation.cross val score() function. This is important to note, because some\n",
    "scores will be reported as negative that by definition can never be negative. I will remind you\n",
    "about this caveat as we work through the lesson.\n",
    "You can learn more about machine learning algorithm performance metrics supported by\n",
    "scikit-learn on the page Model evaluation: quantifying the quality of predictions.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification problems are perhaps the most common type of machine learning problem and as\n",
    "such there are a myriad of metrics that can be used to evaluate predictions for these problems.\n",
    "In this section we will review how to use the following metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Classification Accuracy\n",
    " - Logarithmic Loss\n",
    " - Area Under ROC Curve\n",
    " - Confusion Matrix\n",
    " - Classification Report\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Classification Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the number of correct predictions made as a ratio of all predictions\n",
    "made. This is the most common evaluation metric for classification problems, it is also the most\n",
    "misused. It is really only suitable when there are an equal number of observations in each class\n",
    "(which is rarely the case) and that all predictions and prediction errors are equally important,\n",
    "which is often not the case. Below is an example of calculating classification accuracy."

    "#### Regression Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section will review 3 of the most common metrics for evaluating predictions on regression\n",
    "machine learning problems:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Mean Absolute Error\n",
    " - Mean Squared Error\n",
    " - R2\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Mean Absolute Error\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mean Absolute Error (or MAE) is the sum of the absolute differences between predictions\n",
    "and actual values. It gives an idea of how wrong the predictions were. The measure gives an\n",
    "idea of the magnitude of the error, but no idea of the direction (e.g. over or under predicting).\n",
    "The example below demonstrates calculating mean absolute error on the Boston house price\n",

    "the cross val score() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Mean Squared Error\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mean Squared Error (or MSE) is much like the mean absolute error in that it provides a\n",
    "gross idea of the magnitude of error. Taking the square root of the mean squared error converts\n",
    "the units back to the original units of the output variable and can be meaningful for description\n",

    "value before taking the square root if you are interested in calculating the RMSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### R2 Metric\n",
    "The R2 (or R Squared) metric provides an indication of the goodness of fit of a set of predictions\n",
    "to the actual values. In statistical literature this measure is called the coefficient of determination.\n",
    "This is a value between 0 and 1 for no-fit and perfect fit respectively. The example below\n",
