    "not limited to the version of NumPy and the version of scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Manual Serialization. You might like to manually output the parameters of your\n",
    "learned model so that you can use them directly in scikit-learn or another platform in\n",
    "the future. Often the techniques used internally by machine learning algorithms to make\n",
    "predictions are a lot simpler than those used to learn the parameters can may be easy to\n",
    "implement in custom code that you have control over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take note of the version so that you can re-create the environment if for some reason you\n",
    "cannot reload your model on another machine or another platform at a later time."
