# Machine-Learning-Mastery

This repository focuses on a specific sub-field of machine learning called predictive modeling as it is described by Jason Brownlee in his book "Machine Learning Mastery".

**Lessons**

Lessons are tutorials of each sub-task of a machine learning project map onto Python and the best practice way of working through each task. A predictive modeling machine learning project can be broken down into 6 top-level tasks:
1. Define Problem: Investigate and characterize the problem in order to better understand
the goals of the project.
2. Analyze Data: Use descriptive statistics and visualization to better understand the data
you have available.
3. Prepare Data: Use data transforms in order to better expose the structure of the
prediction problem to modeling algorithms.
4. Evaluate Algorithms: Design a test harness to evaluate a number of standard algorithms
on the data and select the top few to investigate further.
5. Improve Results: Use algorithm tuning and ensemble methods to get the most out of
well-performing algorithms on your data.
6. Present Results: Finalize the model, make predictions and present results.

**Projects**

There are 3 projects:

 - Hello World Project (Iris flowers dataset) : This is a quick pass through the project steps
without much tuning or optimizing on a dataset that is widely used as the hello world of
machine learning.

 - Regression (Boston House Price dataset) : Work through each step of the project process
with a regression problem.

 - Binary Classification (Sonar dataset) : Work through each step of the project process
using all of the methods on a binary classification problem.
